# PI4-2017-stuff

This is my folder for PI4 activities.  My main files are my matlab code.  My project for 2017 was to analyze / compare data generated by lead matrices from time series of activity levels detected in fMRI scans of both normal hearing and tinnitus subjects.  A lot of the code assumed a local stucture in my own computer.  If working from a fixed directory, for example, My leadinfo.m matlab class function was not in my code folder, but just in my fixed directory.  I also had a "Data" folder for leadinfo objects I wanted to save and go back to, and a "Figures" folder for saving data specific to certain subject groups, normalization types of data, data with/without outliers, etc.  Finally, I had a separate folder containing raw data which I accessed, but which is confidential.

This was an internship and I was limited in time, so some of the code is obviously incomplete.  I kept incomplete parts unfixed, but noted them as such, in case any user wishes to change things or improve on it.  Other parts should be working fine.

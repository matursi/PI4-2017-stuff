## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Begin notes

Things to note: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Collecting Data: know your metadata!  This is anything that makes sense of your data but is not the data itself.  How did You collect your data? When? Where?  What types of measurements are you using?  Remember to document your reasoning when working on your research!

\item If you have vocabular in reference to data, define your terms.  Make it so that someone else can read and reproduce your work. 

\item Protocols:  conentional types are scientific publications, lab docs, notebooks, but mordenr collaborative versions include things like Github. 

\end{itemize}

R notes: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Vectors: 1xn 
\item Matrix: mxn
\item Array:  $\Pi n_i$
\item Data frame: contains different types of data, mxn
\item List: sequence of data types

\end{itemize}

Accessing Data: 
Check the directory:
```{bash}
pwd
```


Use the summary funtion for data files: It gives some basic starting stats.   
```{r}
file <- read.csv('grass_yield.csv')

```

Another way to get a sense of the data is to use a histogram. Two main ways of doing this are using the regular hist function, and the ggplot2 library ggplot function: 

```{r}
hist(x)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x),bins = 25)
```

To access the fitness of the distribution, use the datafit function after calling the distrplus library.  It will give you fitness data in four charts.

```{r}
library(fitdistrplus) 
yield_subset <- yield[yield>1]
w<- fitdist(yield_subset,dist = 'weibull')
ln<- fitdist(yield_subset,dist = 'lnorm')
g<- fitdist(yield_subset,dist = 'gamma')
n<- fitdist(yield_subset,dist = 'norm')
plot(g)
plot(n)
plot(ln)
plot(w)
```
```
